To install: Use bower to do "bower install".

If you don't have bower you can get it with "npm install bower"

Installing NPM is up to you to figure out.


Then to run you can use any one of several methods to start a static HTTP server. I prefer running "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" in the game directory.
